abstract = {This paper summarizes ongoing efforts to provide software infrastructure (and methodology) for open-source machine translation that combines a deep semantic transfer approach with advanced stochastic models. The resulting infrastructure combines precise grammars for parsing and generation, a semantic-transfer based translation engine and stochastic controllers. We provide both a qualitative and quantitative experience report from instantiating our general architecture for Japanese--English MT using only open-source components, including HPSG-based grammars of English and Japanese.},
