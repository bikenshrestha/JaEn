This is the data directory containing automatically extracted transfer
rules. The `utils/select-rule.py` script does a glob search
(`$DATADIR/*.mtr`) for finding these files, so if there are any that
should be excluded, they can be moved to a subdirectory (e.g.,
`unused/`), or renamed, etc.

The original README is as follows, although it may not be relevant
anymore:
